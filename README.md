# Lightning Round: GitHub Copilot Advanced Capabilities

> **CAIP CSU Canada — First Lightning Talks Session**

Welcome to the inaugural Lightning Talk session hosted by the CAIP CSU Canada team. This fast-paced, demo-driven session showcases the latest advancements in GitHub Copilot's agentic capabilities, demonstrating how modern AI-assisted development is evolving beyond simple code completion into a fully orchestrated, multi-agent workflow.

---

## Session Overview

This session is structured around **four key demonstration areas** that highlight how GitHub Copilot is transforming the developer experience through intelligent automation, parallelism, and extensibility.

### 1. Sub-Agents Running in Parallel

We demonstrate how Copilot can spin up **multiple sub-agents concurrently** to handle independent tasks — such as searching code, reading files, and running commands — all at the same time. This parallel execution model dramatically reduces turnaround time for complex, multi-step operations and mirrors how experienced developers mentally decompose problems.

**Key takeaways:**
- Parallel tool invocation for independent operations
- Efficient context gathering across large codebases
- Real-world impact on developer velocity

### 2. Agent Skills

Copilot agents can be extended with **domain-specific skills** — self-contained instruction sets that teach the agent how to handle specialized tasks (e.g., generating PowerPoint presentations, scaffolding AI agent workflows, or working with specific frameworks). Skills allow teams to encode institutional knowledge and best practices directly into the AI assistant.

**Key takeaways:**
- Custom skill definitions and activation triggers
- How skills encapsulate domain expertise
- Practical examples of skill-driven workflows

### 3. Background Agent, Cloud Agent & SDK Integrations

We touch on the emerging ecosystem around Copilot's **Background Agent** (autonomous, long-running tasks) and **Cloud Agent** (remote execution in GitHub-hosted environments), along with integrations with **Claude** and the **Codex SDK**. These capabilities push the boundaries of what's possible — from fire-and-forget issue resolution to cloud-scale code generation.

**Key takeaways:**
- Background Agent for asynchronous, hands-off task completion
- Cloud Agent for secure, remote agentic workflows
- Claude and Codex SDK as complementary AI engines

### 4. Copilot CLI & Sub-Agent Architecture

We showcase **GitHub Copilot CLI** and walk through how it leverages **three distinct sub-agents** to handle different categories of developer queries — shell commands, Git operations, and GitHub CLI tasks. This architecture illustrates how specialized agents collaborate under a unified interface.

**Key takeaways:**
- Copilot CLI for terminal-native AI assistance
- Sub-agent routing and specialization
- Practical CLI demos with real commands

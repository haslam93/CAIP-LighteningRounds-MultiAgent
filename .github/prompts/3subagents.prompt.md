description: Run to see multiple subagents in action

Run three sub agents in parallel. One sub agent should go and check the solution for its code coverage percentage and some quick wins to improve code coverage. The second subagent should go and look at the complete solution and create a file called diagrams.md with mermaid diagrams for the flow of the solution. And the third subagent should should go ahead and rate the readability of the whole solution. Give me a percentage.
